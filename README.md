### Hi there ! I'm Sebastian

I'm a bioinformatician that tries to leverage modern web-technologies to create tools to explore large, complex datasets in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. Using data science I try to get new insights linking microbiology to human health. The programming language I enjoy using most is Python, where I use Flask, SciKit-Learn, ... almost daily. Some javascript for the front-end is required as well, here I make use of existing visualization solutions like cytoscape.js and charts.js though I am known to dabble a little with modern frameworks like React and Stencil from time to time.
